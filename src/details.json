    "contentt": "Masala dosa is stuffed dosa. The two parts are the dosa and the stuffing.

The batter will be fermented overnight to make the dosa soft from the inside and crispy from the outside.",
    "ingredients": [
      "2 Cups rice (preferably parboiled)",
      "1/2 cup black Gram (Dhuli Urad)(split and husked)",
      "1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds",
      "2 tsp saltOil (for cooking dosas)",
      "500 gms potatoes (peeled and cubed) boiled ",

     "6-7 Curry leaves",
     "2 tsp salt",
     "1/4 tsp turmeric powdered",
     "1/2 cup water"
    ],
    "method": "Wash and soak the rice in one container and the dal and fenugreek seeds together in another container for 5-6 hours or over night, depending on the weather.2.Grind dal mixture together to a very smooth consistency. Next grind the rice smooth too and mix the two batters.3.Add salt and enough water to make into a dropping consistency. Leave to ferment over-night or more depending on the weather, till a little spongy.4.If thickened too much, add a little water to thin a bit. Heat tawa, and brush oil over it. When really hot, splash a little water over it, and immediately pour batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion.5.This will have to be very swift and will need a bit of practice.6.After spreading the batter, lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges so that it seeps under the dosa.7.When edges start browning a bit, pass a flat spoon under it to ease the dosa off the pan. Put desired filling in the center, and fold the two edges over.8.Serve accompanied with sambhar and chutney.Prepare the masala filling:1.Heat the oil in a heavy based pan and add the mustard seeds, then onions, curry leaves and green chillies, and saute over high heat till the onions are a little transparent.2.Add the salt and the turmeric and mix well, before adding the potatoes.3.Turn the potatoes around till well mixed, and add the water, and let it simmer, for 2-3 minutes."
